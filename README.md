# Persona Palooza
## Inspiration
We've all experienced the monotony of AI chatbots that sound the same, both in text and voice. What if an AI could not only adapt its personality but also speak in different voices that match those personalities? This sparked our idea to create a more immersive conversational experience by combining personality switching with custom voice cloning, making each interaction uniquely engaging and personal.
## What it does
Persona Palooza is an AI assistant that seamlessly switches between 10 distinct personalities, each with their own unique communication style, vocabulary, and most importantly - their own voice! Using voice cloning technology, we've given each personality a custom voice that matches their character, from the calm, measured tones of our Zen Master to the energetic cadence of our Over-Hyped Bro. Users can choose personalities through text or voice commands, and even clone their own voice to create a personalized AI avatar.

## How we built it
We combined multiple technologies to create a comprehensive solution:

- OpenAI API for core natural language processing
- ElevenLabs for voice cloning and generation
- React for the frontend interface
- Node.js for the backend
- Web Speech API for voice commands
- Custom voice processing pipeline for real-time voice cloning

## Challenges we ran into

- Synchronizing voice generation with text responses for natural conversation flow
- Optimizing voice cloning to work efficiently within hackathon time constraints
- Managing latency issues when switching between different voice models
- Balancing voice quality with response time
- Ensuring consistent personality traits across both text and voice interactions
- Handling voice cloning for multiple team members while maintaining distinct characteristics

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully implemented voice cloning for all 10 personalities
- Created a seamless voice switching system that maintains conversation flow
- Developed a user-friendly interface for voice recording and cloning
- Achieved natural-sounding voices that match each personality's characteristics
- Built a fully functional product with both text and voice capabilities within 24 hours
- Successfully cloned team members' voices for demo personalities

## What we learned
- Advanced techniques in voice cloning and audio processing
- The complexities of matching personality traits with voice characteristics
- Strategies for optimizing real-time voice generation
- The importance of voice quality in user engagement
- Methods for handling different voice models efficiently
